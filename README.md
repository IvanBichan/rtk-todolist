# TodoList Project

This is a TodoList project built with React and TypeScript. It utilizes the power of Redux Toolkit (RTK) for state management, and Material-UI (MUI) for styling. The project also makes use of other libraries such as `redux-hook-form`, `formik`, `uuid`, and `axios`.

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Filter tasks based on their status (all, active, completed).
- Data persistence with the backend using Axios.
- Form validation with `formik`.
